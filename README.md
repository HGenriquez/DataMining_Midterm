# DataMining_Midterm
This project focuses on predicting breast cancer recurrence using a classic dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The primary objective is to build and evaluate machine learning models capable of classifying patients into "recurrence-event" or "no-recurrence-event" categories based on nine key attributes. These attributes include patient demographics like age and menopause status, as well as clinical details such as tumor size, the number of involved axillary lymph nodes, and the degree of malignancy. This repository contains the complete analysis in a Jupyter Notebook, detailing every step from initial data exploration to final model evaluation.
